# Server Management

<!-- this is also a TODO for commands to manage the server -->

There are a few commands to help manage the server. To run any of them, first open a terminal and navigate to the `airbattle-hosting` directory:

```bash
cd airbattle-hosting
```

## Setup

To setup the whole repo/server, run:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This will install and build each of the components.

## Start the Server

To start the server, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Running Spatie Bots

In a separate terminal, navigate to the `airbattle-hosting` directory and run (with 10 bots):

```bash
npm run bots -- --num=10
```

## Change Game Mode
